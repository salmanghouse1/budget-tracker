SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling 


# Requirements

Indexeddb steps

1. Open a database.
2. Create an object store in the database.
3. Start a transaction and make a request to do some database operation, like adding or retrieving data.
4. Wait for the operation to complete by listening to the right kind of DOM event.
5. Do something with the results (which can be found on the request object).
